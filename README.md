## 💡 Key Learnings

### Start with Clear Business Problems
The best AI projects solve specific, measurable pain points—not "AI for AI's sake."

### Iterate on Prompts and Architectures
First versions rarely work perfectly. Budget time for experimentation and refinement.

### Monitor Costs from Day One
LLM API expenses and compute costs scale quickly. Implement tracking and budgets early.

### Build for Observability
You can't improve what you don't measure. Log everything, track metrics, visualize performance.

### Design for Failure
AI systems fail in unpredictable ways. Build graceful degradation, retry logic, and human escalation.
